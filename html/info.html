<h2>info</h2>
<p><em>a series of puzzles</em> was devised, planned, and created over the spring break of 2017, mostly due to a lack of other things to do.</p>
<p>there is no particular target audience aside from my peers&mdash;that is, the puzzles are not unreasonably difficult and should not require any in-depth domain-specific knowledge to solve. however, they will likely start off relatively easy and get progressively more difficult.</p>
<p>none of the puzzles are lateral-thinking puzzles; I'll never be trying to "trick" you. they will all have solutions that can be logically justified.</p>
<p>the primary goal here is the enjoyment of the puzzle-solver, but whether there will be a prize for the first person to get to the end is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>collaboration is technically not forbidden, but I strongly suggest that you try the puzzles for yourself. (and if there is a prize, everyone else is your opponent.)</p>
<p>if you haven't solved a puzzle for longer than a day, I will give you a hint if you show me the progress you've made so far, even if it's just wild speculation.</p>
<p>finally, thanks to Lincoln for inspiring this project, and to you for your interest in it.</p>
